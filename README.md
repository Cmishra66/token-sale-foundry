Technologies Used:

Solidity: Smart contract programming language.
OpenZeppelin Contracts: Reusable smart contract components following best practices.
tested using foundry.

Efficiency Considerations:
Gas Costs: Gas costs can be optimized further based on specific requirements.
Token Conversion: Adjust the calculateTokenAmount function based on your token conversion logic.
Security: Additional security measures such as input validation and testing are essential.
Gas Efficiency: Carefully consider gas costs for each function and optimize where possible.
